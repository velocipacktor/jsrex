# jsrex

## What is this?

JS bindings for Cisco T-Rex json-rpc over zmq.

## Why? Isn't there a python lib already?
Yes, there is, and if you know python you should go use that.

## Is this safe to use yet?
No. If you want to use this, pin a commit.

## How do I use this
Install node v16 (or higher, ymmv)
Run t-rex in astf mode

node examples/foo.mjs

## Can I help?
If you want, sure. Pull requests are always welcome.
